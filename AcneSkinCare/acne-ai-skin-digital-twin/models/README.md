# README for AI Models in Acne AI – Skin Digital Twin

## Overview
This directory contains the AI models used in the Acne AI – Skin Digital Twin project. The models are designed to analyze skin conditions based on user-uploaded images and provide insights into skin health.

## Model Architecture
The primary model architecture utilized in this project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been pretrained on a relevant dataset. The model is fine-tuned to recognize various skin conditions and features.

## Training
The models were trained using a dataset of labeled skin images. The training process involved the following steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathering a diverse set of skin images representing various conditions.
2. Preprocessing: Normalizing and augmenting the images to improve model robustness.
3. Training: Utilizing a combination of supervised learning techniques to optimize model performance.
4. Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy and making adjustments as necessary.

## Usage
To use the models in the application:
1. Ensure that the required libraries are installed as specified in the `requirements.txt`.
2. Load the model using the provided functions in `src/ai/model.py`.
3. Run predictions on uploaded images using the functions defined in `src/ai/predict.py`.

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include:
- Expanding the dataset for better model generalization.
- Implementing additional model architectures for comparative analysis.
- Integrating user feedback to continuously improve model accuracy.
